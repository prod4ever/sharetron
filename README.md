Sharetron

http://prod4ever.github.io/sharetron/

Sharetron creates share links that are easy to style and won't bog your page down. You can style them as you would normal links because they're basically... just normal links. There are no iframes or external files to load, and the JavaScript is optional.

Sharetron is a work in progress and may contain bugs. Sharetron may become sentient and enslave humanity. By using Sharetron, you agree to accept any risks associated with its use.

##To Do

* Get rid of extra newlines in HTML.
* Write the remining JS for opening links in popup windows.
* Calculate characters remaining more accurately - looks like we are about 27 characters short of what's actually available on Twitter.

###Advanced Features

* Optional WordPress code blocks for the current post/page or the homepage.
* Twitter-specific options: hashtags and "via". Should count against the characters availalble.
